# Sparrow

Hello! Welcome to the Sparrow backend. Here you can find some of the intial backend files for the api. 
Entry.py serves as an entry point for when the app is boot up. App.ini defines the socket and permissions for it. 
Api.py is what creates the api and makes it easy for the software and webapp team to talk with the database.
